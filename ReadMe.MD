      Sample UEFI Firmware for the N-series Intel® Pentium® Processor
      and Intel® Celeron® Processor Families (formerly Braswell)

The N-series Intel® Pentium® processor and Intel® Celeron® processor families
(formerly Braswell) use a multicore System on a Chip (SoC) based on a new
microarchitecture and are manufactured on Intel’s industry leading tri-gate
14nm process. http://ark.intel.com/products/codename/66094/Braswell#@Embedded 

This sample UEFI firmware is designed for N-series Intel Pentium processor and
Intel Celeron processor families, and has been verified on the Intel Cherry Hill
BSP. This sample codebase uses the Intel UDK2015 core and Intel® Firmware Support
Package (Intel® FSP) to demonstrate building a full UEFI solution by combining
open source EDK II with Intel® FSP binaries.

This code combines elements from github, intel.com/fsp and firmware.intel.com

                            HOW TO CREATE A FULL SOURCE TREE
===============================================================================
1) Create a new folder (directory) on the root of your local development machine
   for use as your work space (for example "C:\MyWorkspace").
   
   NOTE: Some code paths are very long, and placing the working directory too
         deep below the ROOT directory may cause the path to be longer than the 
         operating system or file system's maximum path length.

2) Enter "C:\MyWorkspace", then run following git command to get the
   pentium-celeron-n-udk2015 code branch:
   git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms.git -b pentium-celeron-n-udk2015
  
   Once the download completes, all EDK II packages and files will be found
   under the "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms" directory.

3) Get the BaseTools binary:
   a. git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32.git
   b. git checkout ea691aec89b06aa83474100df1de000a875b4ea0
   c. Put BaseTools Binary "edk2-BaseTools-win32" into MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BaseTools\Bin”, 
   d. Change folder name from "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BaseTools\Bin\edk2-BaseTools-win32”
      to "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BaseTools\Bin\win32”

4) Download the 'Intel® Firmware Support Package for Intel® Pentium® and Celeron®
   Processor N3000 Product Families and Intel® Atom™ x5-E8000 Processor'
   (BSW_MR1) from http://intel.com/fsp
   
5) Run the Intel® FSP installer and copy the following files into the Workspace:
   a. Copy FspUpdVpd.h into the "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\ChvFspBinPkg\Include" directory.
   b. Create the "FspBinary" sub-directory under the "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\ChvFspBinPkg"
      directory, if it does not exist ("C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\ChvFspBinPkg\FspBinary").
   c. Copy BSWFSP.fd into the "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\ChvFspBinPkg\FspBinary" directory.
   
6) Download the 'BraswellPlatformPkg' package from firmware.intel.com:
   https://firmware.intel.com/projects/braswell-uefi

7) Unzip the 'BraswellPlatformPkg' package and move the contents into the Workspace:
   a. Copy the "BraswellPlatformPkg" sub-directory over the existing directory
      in the Workspace ("C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BraswellPlatformPkg"). This will add
      files to the "Microcode", "Stitch" and "UNDI" sub-directories.

8) Follow the instructions found in the "Patch-HOWTO.txt" file located in the Workspace
   (e.g. "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\CryptoPkg\Library\OpensslLib\Patch-HOWTO.txt")
   to install the Openssl source code.

                            HOW TO BUILD (WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT)
================================================================================
OS Configuration:
  Microsoft Windows 8.1 Ultimate 64-bit*
  
1. Setup Build Environment
   1) Install a C compiler (Visual Studio .NET 2008, 2010 or 2013) on the 
      build machine.
      
   2) Install version Python 2.6.4 from: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.4/
      Make sure that a file with the extension of ".py" will be opened by Python.exe.
      
   3) Install the iasl compiler by downloading acpica-win-20141107.zip from the
      following location: "https://acpica.org/downloads/version-20141107" and
      place the unzipped content ("iasl.exe") into the "C:\ASL" directory on your
      local drive (create the folder "C:\ASL" if it does not exist).
       
2. Follow the instructions of "HOW TO CREATE A FULL SOURCE TREE" to create a 
   full source tree.
           
3a. Build Steps (32-bit)
   1) To build a 32-bit release version
      Open a command prompt window (make certain you "Run as Administrator"). 
      Type the command: "cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BraswellPlatformPkg" 
      Type the command "BuildBsw.bat /vs08 /r /ia32 BRAS" to build a release version.
      (/vs08 = Visual Studio 2008; /vs10 = Visual Studio 2010; /vs13 = Visual Studio 2013) 
      
   2) To build a 32-bit debug version
      Open a command prompt window (make certain you "Run as Administrator"). 
      Type the command: "cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BraswellPlatformPkg" 
      Type command "BuildBsw.bat /vs08 /d /ia32 BRAS" to build a debug version.
      (/vs08 = Visual Studio 2008; /vs10 = Visual Studio 2010; /vs13 = Visual Studio 2013) 
               
   3) After the build successfully completes, the 8MB firmware binary image
      will be located in "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BraswellPlatformPkg\Stitch\"      

3b. Build Steps (64-bit)
   1) To build a 64-bit release version
      Open a command prompt window (make certain you "Run as Administrator"). 
      Type the command: "cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BraswellPlatformPkg"
      Type the command "BuildBsw.bat /vs08 /r BRAS" to build a release version.
      (/vs08 = Visual Studio 2008; /vs10 = Visual Studio 2010; /vs13 = Visual Studio 2013) 
      
   2) To build a 64-bit debug version
      Open a command prompt window (make certain you "Run as Administrator"). 
      Type the command: "cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BraswellPlatformPkg" 
      Type command "BuildBsw.bat /vs08 /d BRAS" to build a debug version.
      (/vs08 = Visual Studio 2008; /vs10 = Visual Studio 2010; /vs13 = Visual Studio 2013) 
               
   3) After the build successfully completes, the 8MB firmware binary image
      will be located in "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\BraswellPlatformPkg\Stitch\"
