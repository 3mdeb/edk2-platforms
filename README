This repository is used by EDK II sample platforms.

The EDK II sample platforms live upstream in the EDK II repository,
but they may use this repository for platform specific branches and
tags.

The branches and tags created should have a name that is associated
with the platform that they are used for. This will prevent confusion
about which sample platform uses the branch or tag.
